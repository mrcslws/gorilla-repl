# Gorilla REPL

Gorilla is a rich REPL for Clojure in the notebook style. If you're interested you should take a look at its
[website](http://gorilla-repl.org).

## This fork

```
[com.mrcslws/gorilla-repl "0.3.5-006"]
```

This fork adds capabilities to Gorilla REPL. See commits for more info.

These commits generally aren't elegant. They're quick updates to coerce Gorilla REPL into doing currently-unsupported things. If someone ever comes up with an elegant way to do these things, I'd love to abandon this fork.
